**Description**
<p align="justify">
Ft_Irc aims to teach us on the basic standard protocol of the "Internet Relay Chat", by creating a Server daemon written in c++98.
The program will allow us to touch on sockets, connections, and non-blocking operations.
It's an interesting project to understand where modern chat-based communication apps originate from, as well as how server to client communication is usually handled.
